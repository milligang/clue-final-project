For our project, we chose to take the board game CLUE and make a CS-50 themed version, featuring the murder of the CS50 Duck here at Harvard. When you go to the webpage, a pop-up will appear announcing that this is CS50 CLUE, and you can then click to begin.

Since CLUE is a two-player game, the device should be passed between the two players with only one player looking at the screen at a time. The first-player's cards are shown on the screen when you click begin; therefore it is important for the other player to not be sneaking a look since no one wants to play with a cheater. The first player will then have the opportunity to see their own cards that they have been given, and then the ability to go from there to either a page displaying all of the possibility card options, or the game board. If the player clicks on the all cards page they will have the ability to get from there back to their own cards. If the player goes to the gameboard they will be able to click any of the locations on the gameboard to use as their guess. Clicking on any of these images except the central image (university hall) will take you to the guessing page.

On the guessing page, the place will be autofilled based on the location the user chooses; however, the user will have the opportunity to choose a person and a weapon in their guess. Upon filling in these dropdowns, the user can submit their guess. The screen will then shift to a field for the opposing player where they can pick from a dropdown of their available cards options to show the player. The theory behind this decision is that much like in the game of CLUE, a player can use strategy to decide which cards they wish to show their opponent, such as trying to only show cards with location. After this, the game returns to the second player's cards, so once again it is important for the first player to not cheat by looking at the second player's cards.


The second player's turn will occur in the same manner that the first player's turn did, with the same opportunities. Everytime the user submits a guess the turns will switch, as they do in the original board game.


Once a player believes they know what the correct answer is they will choose University Hall (the building in the center of the game board which functions as the pool does in CLUE). From there they will be able to submit a final guess that will be deemed either correct, making them the winner, or incorrect, and will reveal the correct answer to the game.
